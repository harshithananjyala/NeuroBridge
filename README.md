## Problem Statement

Technology often lacks empathy. Neurodiverse individuals face interfaces that overwhelm, confuse, or ignore their cognitive language.

NeuroBridge transforms this experience by creating an adaptive, emotionally aware ecosystem that:
* listens,
* learns and
* evolves with every unique mind.

## End Users

* Students experiencing stress or burnout
* Individuals with ADHD, autism spectrum traits, or anxiety
* People who prefer conversational interaction over forms
* Anyone seeking a supportive digital companion
